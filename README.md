# Docker Host Configurations

This Ansible Playbook is used in combination with the "Docker_deployments" repository. Its primary use is to run the initial configuration on a newly deployed linux machine. This playbook's purpose is to install the needed dependencies, environmental variables, and shared folder mappings to prepare for the docker deployments terraform code to then be ran afterwards.
